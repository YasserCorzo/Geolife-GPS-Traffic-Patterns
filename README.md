Project title: Predicting future traffic patterns and loading using GPS trajectories

Description of project: We plan on using Microsoftâ€™s Geolife GPS trajectory dataset to predict future traffic patterns and loading for our final project. 
The comprehensive dataset contains 17,621 trajectories for a total distance of 1.2 million kilometers and a total time duration of over 48,000 hours from the years 2007 to 2012. 
To process this massive dataset, we will first perform feature extraction using methods like kernel LDA, k-means clustering, and specifically PCA for dimensionality reduction purposes. 
Then, we will perform the inference process to predict future traffic in certain areas of the world using the following four estimation, detection, and learning techniques and algorithms 
learned in lecture: linear statistical regression as a comparison baseline, support vector regression, deep neural networks, and an ensemble learning method like AdaBoost to reduce bias.
